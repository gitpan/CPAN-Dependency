CPAN::Dependency
================

DESCRIPTION

    This module can process a set of distributions, up to the whole CPAN, 
    and extract the dependency relations between these distributions. 
    It also calculates a score for each distribution based on the number 
    of times it appears in the prerequisites of other distributions.
